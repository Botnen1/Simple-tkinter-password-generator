future development of this project:


Strength Indicator:

Add a visual indicator (e.g., color or strength level) to show the strength of the generated password (weak, medium, strong).
Copy to Clipboard:

~~Include a button to copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy usage.
Password Complexity Options:~~

Allow the user to choose the complexity of the generated password (e.g., include/exclude uppercase letters, numbers, special characters).
Generate Multiple Passwords:

Allow the user to generate multiple passwords at once, and display them in a list.
Save Passwords:

Add a feature to save generated passwords to a file.
Customizable Character Sets:

Allow users to customize the character sets used in password generation (e.g., add/remove specific characters).
Error Handling:

Improve error handling by providing clear messages to the user when an error occurs (e.g., invalid input, password length too long).
Clear Button:

Add a button to clear the generated password and reset the input fields.
User-Friendly Messages:

Use user-friendly messages in the GUI to guide the user (e.g., instead of printing to console, display messages in the GUI).
Responsive Design:

Make the GUI responsive to different screen sizes and resolutions.
Validation for Non-Numeric Input:

Add validation to ensure that the user enters a numeric value for the password length.
Use of Functions:

Consider breaking down the functionality into smaller functions to improve code readability and maintainability.
Comments:

Add comments in the code to explain the purpose of different sections or functions.
Consistent Styling:

Maintain a consistent style throughout the GUI (e.g., font, colors).
